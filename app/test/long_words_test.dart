// Every screen, drawn in the languages that write the longest words.
//
// The layout was set in English, and English is short. "Done" is four letters where German asks
// for "Abgeschlossen", Russian for "Завершено" and Polish for "Zakończone"; "Settings" is one word
// where German wants "Einstellungen öffnen" on a button. A width that held in the language the app
// was written in is not a width that holds, and the place it stops holding is the narrowest phone
// still in use with its text turned up.
//
// So the three longest of the nineteen are drawn here, on that phone, at three text sizes.
// Nothing is asserted about how it looks: a line that runs off the edge reports itself, because a
// `RenderFlex overflowed` is an exception and an exception fails the test it was thrown in. What
// this file buys is that somebody has to be looking — a screenshot in German is something a person
// remembers to take, and this is not.
//
// **The bar here is higher than any phone.** A widget test draws in a font whose every glyph is a
// full square, so a word of ten letters is ten ems wide where a real face would set it in five or
// six. Everything below therefore fits with room to spare on a real screen, and that headroom is
// the point: the width a translator's word will want is not knowable from here.
//
// **It does not catch a line that merely reads badly.** Text that wraps to four lines, or is cut
// off with an ellipsis, is inside its box and passes here. Those are read on a phone; this holds
// the floor under them.
