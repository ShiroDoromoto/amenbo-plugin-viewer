/// **The app has to be complete on its own.** Store review takes as long as it takes, so there
/// will be users running this build against an Amenbo and a plugin that know nothing about it.
/// Nothing here may depend on either one being present, and no state that follows from their
/// absence is an error: an app nobody has paired yet is working correctly.

/// What it shows is decided in [ViewerHome]: the setup instructions on a phone with no way in,
