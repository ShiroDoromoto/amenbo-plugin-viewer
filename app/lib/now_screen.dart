/// "Tasks" — the four states, one at a time.
///
/// This is the screen the app is opened for, and what it is asked is nearly always one of four
/// questions: what is being worked on, what is stuck, what is next, what got finished. So the
/// screen is divided the way the backlog itself is — by Amenbo's own status — and the person moves
/// between the four rather than scrolling past them. The same four they read on the PC, in the
/// same words, so there is nothing to learn twice.
///
/// Four rules shape everything below.
///
/// * **Divided by state, not by whether it can be started.** Whether a task's premises are met is
///   derived, and it changes overnight without the task moving. A row waiting on something stays
///   in `todo` and says what it is waiting on.
/// * **One state is read to its end.** A window at a time, asked for by reaching the bottom —
///   there is no "N more" that hands the rest to another screen. Finished work is all of it,
///   newest first, with the date written in wherever it changes: the device holds the whole copy,
///   so a cut-off would be hiding rows that are already here.
/// * **The floor is never swapped while someone is standing on it.** Rows that arrive on their own
///   are counted, not applied — the person presses a pill when they are ready. The exception is a
///   list that is still empty, where there is nothing to pull out from under anyone and a first
///   sync should be seen filling up.
/// * **Projects narrow, they do not divide.** Everything the machine sends is stacked together by
///   default, because "what moved overnight" is not a question anybody asks one project at a time.
/// * **The top is one line.** When the picture was taken, and the way to take a newer one. It is
///   the first thing the eye lands on, and what the person came to read is under it.
