///
/// * **nothing states its size.** Sizes come from the text theme, which follows the setting the

/// * **nothing states its colour, spacing or corner either.** They come from [Palette], [Space]
///   and [Corner], so the whole app can be moved at once.
/// * **no state is carried by colour alone.** Priority, lateness and unread all come with a word
///   or a shape beside them — see `marks.dart`.
