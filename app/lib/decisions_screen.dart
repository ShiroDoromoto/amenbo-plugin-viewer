/// "Decisions" — all of them, newest first, and nothing in front of them.
///
/// A decision is not looked for, it is read: the person knows one was made and wants to see what
/// it said, and what they reach for it by is when it happened. That is a list in date order, and a
/// short one — a backlog holds thousands of tasks and tens of decisions — so the whole face is one
/// scroll with no question above it to answer first.
///
/// It sat behind the second tab of the search face until now, which put a search in front of the
/// one thing on this phone nobody searches for.
///
/// Two things it deliberately does not do.
///
/// * **Nothing is excluded by state.** One nobody has ruled on yet is the one most worth reading,
///   and the row says which it is.
/// * **It is never ordered by anything but when.** The list is what memory reaches into, and
///   memory reaches by date.
///
/// The rows are read off the store when the face is arrived at rather than while it is being read
/// — the shell rebuilds it per visit — so nothing is swapped out from under a thumb halfway down.
