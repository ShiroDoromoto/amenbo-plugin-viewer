# check-ci-aggregate.sh — keep the merge gate's `needs:` complete.
#
# ci.yml ends in one aggregate job that every other job feeds, and that job's name is the single check
# main requires. It waits for what its `needs:` names and nothing else — so a job added without a line
# there is a job the required check never waits for. The run is green, the merge goes through, and
# nothing anywhere says the job was not counted. That is the one failure mode a red build cannot
# report, which is why it is asked here instead.
#
# Two things are checked. That the two lists agree: every job in the file is named in the aggregate's
# `needs:`, and that list names only jobs that exist. And that the aggregate still runs on `always()`:
# without it a failed dependency SKIPS the aggregate rather than failing it, and a skipped required
# check is not a red one.
#
# Usage: guards/check-ci-aggregate.sh    (no args; reads the workflow below)
# Exit codes: 0 = the gate waits for every job, 1 = it drifted.
